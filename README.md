UPD Mar 10: Added squares images creation (create_square.c), compiles, needs checking on errors. 

Upd Mar 13, 4pm: Works, but the squares are not shown accurately according to the map outline. Likely put_images_to_win issue (create_map_win.c).

Upd Mar 13, 6pm: Added create_cpe.c with capybara image. Transparency not working. 

Upd Mar 16, 9pm: First working version with mandatory part done.
